    <p>A newspaper acts an important medium to control corruption and scams. The chief topics of general interest in
        newspaper includes politics, social issues, sports, economy, movies, and share market.

        Newspaper is a mode of mass communication. It is very helpful in creating social awareness. Newspaper raises
        voices against social issues such as child labor, dowry system, etc. They urge the common people to act and
        behave in a rational manner.

        We get the information of the forthcoming movies and television shows through a newspaper. It also contains a
        list of multiplexes with time-schedule for the movies.

        A wide coverage of information is obtained at low cost though newspaper. It also influences the habit of
        thinking in men. It has also seen that illiterate adults are taking up education to read newspaper.

        There are such dailies that trade on such dirty tricks for survival. Being politically left or right, they
        misrepresent strikes and lockouts. Events like bank robbery and train accident or similar untoward events are
        distorted or exaggerated. They deliberately make their news sensational because it appeals to the less educated
        and less cultured more directly.

        The dignity and reputation of a newspaper rests on the degree of their fidelity to truth and fearless reporting.
        It is our cheapest and most powerful weapon in the last analysis.</p>
